A converation simulator that builds up a database of appropriate responses over conversations. Theoretically, it would be able to accumulate a vast databse. I plan to facilitate this by developing a web interface, and adapting the program for deployment on a server. Another goal of the project is to implement context-awareness, and have the simulator respond not randomly from a pool of appropriate responses to any given input, but in a way that analyses the context of the input in order to give a more relevant output.

Usage: python main.py
I have yet to implement any arguments. Be aware that 'reset', 'save', 'load', and 'quit' are reserved keywords which trigger specific function in the program.
